[Interns with toasters: how I taught people about load balancers](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/21/lb/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav)
> Several years ago, I wrote a description of a problem that could happen in a large load-balanced environment. When it landed on certain web sites, some of the commenters dismissed either it ("impossible") or me ("doesn't know anything about load balancing"). Those are both wrong. I suspect what happened is that they didn't understand the problem, and so resorted to ineffective means to steer the attention away from their own inadequacies.

[Go: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](https://bluxte.net/musings/2018/04/10/go-good-bad-ugly/)
> This is an additional post in the “Go is not good” series. Go does have some nice features, hence the “The Good” part in this post, but overall I find it cumbersome and painful to use when we go beyond API or network servers (which is what it was designed for) and use it for business domain logic. But even for network programming, it has a lot of gotchas both in its design and implementation that make it dangerous under an apparent simplicity.

[How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)
> One week in 2007, two friends (Dean and Bill) independently told me they were amazed at Google's spelling correction. Type in a search like [speling] and Google instantly comes back with Showing results for: spelling. I thought Dean and Bill, being highly accomplished engineers and mathematicians, would have good intuitions about how this process works. But they didn't, and come to think of it, why should they know about something so far outisde their specialty?
