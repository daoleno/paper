[Meltdown and Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=featured#faq-wild)

> Vulnerabilities in modern computers leak passwords and sensitive data.

[Reading privileged memory with a side-channel](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=featured)

> We have discovered that CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts.

> There is presently an embargoed security bug impacting apparently all contemporary CPU architectures that implement virtual memory, requiring hardware changes to fully resolve. 

[WHY RASPBERRY PI ISN’T VULNERABLE TO SPECTRE OR MELTDOWN](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-raspberry-pi-isnt-vulnerable-to-spectre-or-meltdown/)

> Over the last couple of days, there has been a lot of discussion about a pair of security vulnerabilities nicknamed Spectre and Meltdown. These affect all modern Intel processors, and (in the case of Spectre) many AMD processors and ARM cores. Spectre allows an attacker to bypass software checks to read data from arbitrary locations in the current address space; Meltdown allows an attacker to read data from arbitrary locations in the operating system kernel’s address space (which should normally be inaccessible to user programs).

[Write your own miniature Redis with Python](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/building-a-simple-redis-server-with-python/)

> The other day the idea occurred to me that it would be neat to write a simple Redis-like database server. While I've had plenty of experience with WSGI applications, a database server presented a novel challenge and proved to be a nice practical way of learning how to work with sockets in Python. In this post I'll share what I learned along the way.

[Ten Things I Wish I’d Known About bash](https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/01/06/ten-things-i-wish-id-known-about-bash/)

> Here I’ve focussed on the things that either confused me or increased my power and productivity in bash significantly, and tried to communicate them (as in my book) in a way that emphasises getting the understanding right.

[SQL Keys in Depth](https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-01-01-sql-keys-in-depth.html)

> The internet is full of dogmatic commandments for choosing and using keys in relational databases. At times it verges on a holy war: should you use natural or artificial keys? Auto-incrementing integers, UUIDs?
