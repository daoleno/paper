[Master the Rebase (and the Other Way Around)](https://blog.algolia.com/master-git-rebase/)

> Git `rebase` is one of those commands that you may have heard of as a substitute for `merge`. Truth is, it’s more than that — `rebase` is a completely different set of tools that intersect with the goals achieved by `merge`. 

[Dumbcoin - An educational python implementation of a bitcoin-like blockchain](https://github.com/julienr/ipynb_playground/blob/master/bitcoin/dumbcoin/dumbcoin.ipynb)

> This is an experimental notebook that implements most of the concepts of a bitcoin-like blockchain in python. It is NOT secure neither a real blockchain and you should NOT use this for anything else than educational purposes.

[How do Ruby & Python profilers work?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/12/17/how-do-ruby---python-profilers-work-/)

> In this post, we’re just going to focus on CPU profilers (and not, say, memory/heap profilers). I’ll explain some basic general approaches to writing a profiler, give some code examples, and take a bunch of examples of popular Ruby & Python profilers and tell you how they work under the hood.

[SQL Injection Wiki](https://sqlwiki.netspi.com/)

This wiki assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL injection, please go here for an introduction if you are unfamiliar.

[Argument-Dependent Lookup](https://abseil.io/tips/49)

> When C++ code refers to a function by an unqualified name, the compiler performs a search for a matching function declaration. What is surprising to some people (and different from other languages) is that in addition to the caller’s lexical scope, the set of search scopes is augmented by namespaces associated with the function argument types. This additional lookup is called Argument-Dependent Lookup (ADL). 

[编程的智慧](http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2015/11/21/programming-philosophy)

> 编程是一种创造性的工作，是一门艺术。精通任何一门艺术，都需要很多的练习和领悟，所以这里提出的“智慧”，并不是号称一天瘦十斤的减肥药，它并不能代替你自己的勤奋。然而由于软件行业喜欢标新立异，喜欢把简单的事情搞复杂，我希望这些文字能给迷惑中的人们指出一些正确的方向，让他们少走一些弯路，基本做到一分耕耘一分收获。
