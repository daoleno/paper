[The real cause of large DDoS - IP Spoofing](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-root-cause-of-large-ddos-ip-spoofing/#fn2)
> All the gigantic headline-grabbing attacks are what we call "L3" (Layer 3 OSI[1]). This kind of attack has a common trait - the malicious software sends as many packets as possible onto the network. For greater speed these packets are hand crafted by attackers - they are not generated using high-level, well-behaved libraries. Packets are mashed together as a series of bytes and fired onto the network to inflict the greatest damage.

[History of the browser user-agent string](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav)
> In the beginning there was NCSA Mosaic, and Mosaic called itself NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1), and Mosaic displayed pictures along with text, and there was much rejoicing.

[What is the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-gil/)
> In this article you’ll learn how the GIL affects the performance of your Python programs, and how you can mitigate the impact it might have on your code.

[How to dismantle a compiler bomb](https://codeexplainer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-dismantle-compiler-bomb/)
> You have heard of “zip bombs” (a tiny ZIP file that decompresses to multiple gigabytes) and “XML bombs” (small XML file abusing the entities to consume lots of memory), and now there is a “compiler bomb” to follow suit.  The idea is quite similar — the source code is only 14 bytes, but the generated executable will be over 16 GB in size.

[The Fibonacci Problem](https://blog.des.io/posts/2018-03-08-fibonacci.html)
> In this article we will investigate the famous Fibonacci sequence from the perspective of tail-recursion. We will see that the Fibonacci sequence requires more advanced reasoning than the problem we explored in a previous article and we will practice new tactics in our pursuit of refactoring to a strict tail-recursive solution.

[Creating An HTML5 Game Bot Using Python](https://vesche.github.io/articles/01-stabbybot.html)
> A few weeks back, I was having a very boring night and stumbled upon stabby.io and quickly had an IO game addiction relapse (think agar, but I’ve been through treatment). You spawn into a small map of players identical to yourself and can kill anyone around you. The vast majority of players around you are computer players, and you have to determine who the human players are. I got drunk and played the game in an unproductive blur for hours, it was glorious.

[Writing a Microservice in Rust](http://www.goldsborough.me/rust/web/tutorial/2018/01/20/17-01-11-writing_a_microservice_in_rust/)
> Let me begin this article on Writing a Microservice in Rust by talking about C++. I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and contributing talks to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it.
