> I'm going to describe in detail what microservices are, why the pattern is so appealing, and also some of the key challenges that they present.

[Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/)
> What is web scraping all about? Consider the following scenario: Imagine that one day, out of the blue, you find yourself thinking “Gee, I wonder who the five most popular mathematicians are?”

[gRPC Load Balancing](https://grpc.io/blog/loadbalancing)
> This post describes various load balancing scenarios seen when deploying gRPC. If you use gRPC with multiple backends, this document is for you.

[Understanding internals of Python classes](https://rushter.com/blog/python-class-internals/)
> The goal of this series is to describe internals and general concepts behind the class object in Python 3.6. In this part, I will explain how Python stores and lookups attributes. I assume that you already have a basic understanding of object-oriented concepts in Python.

[How do you spy on a program running in a container?
](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/01/26/spy-container/)
> Yesterday I added Linux container support to rbspy, so that an instance of rbspy running on the host machine can profile Ruby programs running in containers.This was a pretty simple thing (~50 lines of code, https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/pull/68 ), but I thought it would be fun to explain what adding “container support” involves in practice!

[Introduction to Functional Programming in Python](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/introduction-functional-programming-python/)
> Most of us have been introduced to Python as an object-oriented language; a language exclusively using classes to build our programs. While classes, and objects, are easy to start working with, there are other ways to write your Python code. Languages like Java can make it hard to move away from object-oriented thinking, but Python makes it easy.
