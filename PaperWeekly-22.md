[Event Sourcing made Simple](https://kickstarter.engineering/event-sourcing-made-simple-4a2625113224)
>  Event Sourcing is to data what Git is to code. We’ve implemented a minimal event sourcing framework at Kickstarter to power d.rip. It’s simple and it has made our life so much better! Read on!

[Docker is the dangerous gamble which we will regret](http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/docker-is-a-dangerous-gamble-which-we-will-regret)
> There is perhaps one good argument for using Docker. It is hidden by the many bad arguments for using Docker. I’m going to try to explain why so much Docker rhetoric is stupid, and then look at what reason might be good.

[EFAIL](https://efail.de/)
> EFAIL describes vulnerabilities in the end-to-end encryption technologies OpenPGP and S/MIME that leak the plaintext of encrypted emails

[An Analysis of vgo](https://sdboyer.io/vgo/intro/)
>  In that post, I indicated that I would be working on an assessment of vgo that I would make public as soon as I could.

> Different uses for read-optimized B-trees and write-optimized LSM-trees

[The memory models that underlie programming languages](http://canonical.org/~kragen/memory-models/)
> There are about six major conceptualizations of memory, which I’m calling “memory models”², that dominate today’s programming. Three of them derive from the three most historically important programming languages of the 1950s — COBOL, LISP, and FORTRAN — and the other three derive from the three historically important data storage systems: magnetic tape, Unix-style hierarchical filesystems, and relational databases.

[Dynamic Programming – 7 Steps to Solve any DP Interview Problem](http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/)
> Despite having significant experience building software products, many engineers feel jittery at the thought of going through a coding interview that focuses on algorithms. I’ve interviewed hundreds of engineers and some of the most common questions that make engineers uneasy are the ones that involve Dynamic Programming (DP).
